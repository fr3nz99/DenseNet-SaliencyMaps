# DenseNet-SaliencyMaps

The project has been done as Homework for the course "Neural Networks for Data Science and Applications" from Sapienza - Universit√† di Roma in the academic year 2023/2024.

The aim of the project is to train a Deep Learning model and observe the effect of the gradients on the data. \\
In order to do that, three different kinds of Saliency Maps are applied.
